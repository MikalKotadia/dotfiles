# Agent Instructions


Use context7 ANYTIME you are wanting to use a language or library feature, that you may not be familiar with, or where patterns don't exist in the codebase.
That include for adding a new library to confirm new versions.


Anytime you want to ask the user a question, use the question tool. THIS IS IMPERATIVE.

ALWAYS create helper functions if you find yourself repeating code, whether new, or existing AS LONG as its not "1 line wrapper functions".
